# Why do these ratings at all, I watch all the games live
This ratings is for those who for some reason (for example, time zone) can not watch games live, but wants to watch the most interesting for him game tapes after the end of the game week or in the offseason.

# How read game rating (```GR```) values?
- ```GR > 5.5```, game slightly above average
- ```GR > 6.5```, 30% best games
- ```GR > 7.5```, 10% best games. These games are in the top 100 in NCAAF and top 30 in NFL for the season
- ```GR > 7.8```, 5% best games. These games are in the top 50 in NCAAF and top 10 in NFL for the season
- ```GR > 8.4```, 1% best games. These games are in the top 10 in NCAAF and top 3 in NFL for the season
- ```GR > 9```, incredible game. These games come around once every few years
- ```GR = 10```, unreachable ideal. These games not exist

# What factors does the rating take into account?
- score efficiency
- how close result is, overtime
- game stats (yards, touchdowns, fumbles, sacks, interceptions)
- outcome surprise, twists and turns during the game
- number of leadership changes

# What factors does the rating NOT take into account?
- teams power or popularity
- players power or popularity, spectacular stunts from the players
- your or my sympathies for a particular team
- having Taylor Swift in the bleachers

These are factors that everyone has to consider for themselves.   
For example, if teams you like are playing and the rating shows a ```GR > 5```(this game is above average), you will probably be satisfied watching this game.

# Where do I watch game tapes?
Every man for himself
